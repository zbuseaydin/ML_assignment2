# CMPE462 - Machine Learning Assignment 2
## Part 1: Decision Trees
### Dependencies
- sklearn
- sklearn.model_selection
- sklearn.linear_model
- sklearn.ensemble
- matplotlib.pyplot
- numpy
- pandas
### Data
Data is under the "breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic" directory which is in the same directory as the script.
### Running the Code
The script can be run with the following command:
```python3 decision_tree.py```
### Output
The script outputs the following plots:
- Max depth of the decision tree vs accuracy
- The learned tree
- Number of selected features vs the accuracy of the logistic regression model
- Number of trees of the random forest vs accuracy
And it also prints out the training accuracy and test accuracy of the decision tree.
